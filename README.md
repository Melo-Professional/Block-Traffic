# Block Traffic
A small program to block network traffic from any active window.

**How it works?**
It will create a firewall rule (Windows system) to block network traffic from current active window program by specific ammount of time.
It will place an icon at system tray where you can set your hotkey and time length.

**How to install?**
Just download and run `Block Traffic.exe`. Its a portable compilation. No need to install.
Alternatively I provided the source code if you wish to take a look.
